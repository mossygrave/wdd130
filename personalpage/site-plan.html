      <p>
        This website is a place for Mina’s future customers to visit. They will be able to see examples of her work, the services she provides, and ways to contact her to make appointments. There will also be links to her social media pages that will have more examples of her work. The home page will have a picture of Mina with a summary of what her company does underneath. Her company provides esthetician services with a professional atmosphere and a personal touch. Mina will always aim to have her customers leave feeling beautiful and confident. The home page will also include the names of the professional product lines she uses such as Brow Code, Esthemax, and Farmhouse Fresh. The home page will provide a glimpse of the aesthetic Mina aims to achieve. It will match the shop she will potentially open in the future. The website is meant to be welcoming and calming.

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        Mina's services include eyebrow tinting and laminating, makeup, eyelash lifts and tints, facials, waxing, back treatments, dermaplaning, and body wraps. Eyebrow tinting is where semi-permanent dye is used to darken your eyebrows to make them more prominent. Eyebrow lamination is a treatment that keeps your eyebrows shaped, smooth and styled. Makeup looks can range from natural to full-face. Lash lifts enhance your natural lashes by making them curl out more. This treatment is often paired with a lash tint which darkens your lashes. These in combination make your lashes pop. Facials help clear and moisturize your skin. Facials help your skin feel healthier. Waxing options include legs, arms, underarms, and eyebrows. A service will also be available to treat your back, helping the skin expel excess oils and toxins. Dermaplaning will also be available. Dermaplaning is a treatment used to help scarring from acne heal and disappear. Body wraps are used as a quick way to lose water weight. All of these services will have a more in-depth description and a picture related to the service with it. I will need to add more pictures and services in the future since Mina is still practicing and learning. This page will include every service she offers and allow customers to gain detailed information on them. Price will also be included on this page but that is information I still need to collect.
