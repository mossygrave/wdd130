    <p>Hello! I am currently working toward a BS in computer science and I'm in my third year at BYUI. I changed my major not too long ago and still have 
        to catch up on some of the beginner courses. I love playing video games, crocheting, watching anime, and spending time with my husband and our cat. 
        I have a lot of different career interests such as cybersecurity and video game development and I love the fact that BYUI has so many options and 
        opportunities for growth, learning and career development.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church my entire life and I just recieved a calling as a sunday school teacher in my ward. I've been pondering the value and importance of temples recently and I love the Prophet's talk 'Think Celestial".</p>
    <p>I hope to learn a lot this semester and thank you all for reading my web page.</p>
